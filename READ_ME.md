Little2DGame
=======

## Idea

The idea behind this game is to make a kind of 2D plaform game with elements of RPG such as neutral characters and player inventory.

## Current state

This game is a work in progress. I'm currenly focusing on the core functionalities and the proper level editing will be done at a later stage. Which means the levels present at this point are only there for a testing purpose.

## Motivation

The purpose of this game is just a personal exercice which I'll try to make playable. I don't intent to publish this game in any way.

## Installation

If you're run a 64bit Windows you can try running the executable in the bin folder. Otherwise, you'll have to compile everything using MinGW.

## Reference

The core of this game is loosely based on LazyFoo's tutorial (http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/).

## License

This is obviously for everyone to take and enjoy.
