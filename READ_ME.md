Little2DGame
=======

## Idea

The idea behind this game is to make a kind of 2D platform game with elements of RPG such as neutral characters and player inventory.

## Current state

### Now

This game is a work in progress. I'm currenly focusing on the core functionalities and the proper level editing will be done at a later stage. Which means the levels present at this point are only there for a testing purpose.

### Coming up

1. Music & Sounds (I started working on it already)
2. Better looking graphics and animations
3. 32bit & Linux release

## Motivation

The purpose of this game is just a personal exercice which I'll try to make as playable as I possibly can. But I don't intent to publish this game in any way.

## Installation

If you're run a 64bit Windows you can try running the executable in the bin folder (along with the dll's). Otherwise, you'll have to compile everything using MinGW.

## Environment

I used Code::Blocks 13.12 as IDE with MinGW (GCC 4.8.1).

## Libraries

The libraries requires for this game to run are :
1. SDL2
2. SDL2_Image
3. SDL2_TTF

## Reference

The core of this game is loosely based on LazyFoo's tutorial [link](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/).

## License

This is obviously for everyone to take and enjoy.
